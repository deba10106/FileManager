# FileManager

It is a small python file manager. It considers the location of the file myapp.py as default path and asks for a folder path relative to the default path. If no folder path is provided, it accepts the default path and searches for all document files inside the location folder. It does not touch the folders. It creates three folders depending on what kinds of files are there. 

1. All arxiv pdfs are moved to arXiv folder created by it.

2. All other pdfs are moved to PDFs folder created by it.

3. All other types of files are moved to the Documents folder created by it.
